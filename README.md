# Landscaper CLI

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/gardener/landscapercli)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/gardener/landscapercli)

The Landscaper CLI supports users to develop, maintain, and test components processed by the 
[Landscaper](https://github.com/gardener/landscaper). This comprises the handling of objects like component descriptors, 
blueprints, installations, etc. 

The Landscaper CLI integrates the commands of the [Components CLI](https://github.com/gardener/component-cli).

The Landscaper CLI adds commands for the following use cases:

- Automatic setup of a landscaper and an OCI registry for development  
- Development of components including a component descriptor and blueprint  
- Local validation of such components  
- Support for testing components on a kubernetes cluster  
- Support for accessing and maintaining components with a blueprint in OCI registry

**Remark: This version of the Landscaper CLI requires that you have installed helm version 3.7 or higher
due to some fundamental API changes especially with respect to the handling of helm charts stored as OCI resources.**

curl -LO "curl -LO https://github.com/gardener/landscapercli/releases/latest/download/landscapercli-${os}-${arch}.gz"
gunzip landscapercli-${os}-${arch}.gz
chmod +x ./landscapercli-${os}-${arch}

# Move the binary in to your PATH
